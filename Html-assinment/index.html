            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is <em>Jonathan Pierre</em> I was born The 24<sup>th</sup> of September 2004.
                I am currently a college student at Algonquin college I used to go to a French catholic high school
                called Pierre Savard.
                Its located in my hometown Barrhaven and I am ready to learn in my new environment even though it may be
                difficult,
                I still try to motivate myself the best I can, and when I'm feeling down without motivation, I tell my
                self this quote.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Wise Jonathan once said one who has time to cry and feel bad About life
                has time to do something about his situation <cite>- WISE JOE</cite>

            <p>
                I have many small hobbies, that arent particularly special, but I still do enjoy them quite a bit like
                reading novels and manga, playing video games with friends.
                I also quite enjoy going out to take pictures with friends or by myself and I feel more attracted to
                taking street photography and portrait photography.
